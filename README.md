Note that the server will correctly display a 404 message for path `/`. Check `endpoints.json` for available paths to make a request to an existing endpoint.

Description
This is a back-end project built as part of the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp course. This project covers various aspects of back-end development including creating a server, building RESTful API, using MVC architecture, retrieving data from database, writing integration testsï¼Œhandling errors, and deploying the application to the cloud.
Technology used includes node-postgres, Express.js, PSQL, etc. During the process of development, I also exercised my version control skills using Git, especially in dealing with branches and resolving conflicts.
